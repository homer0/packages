 * Generates a function to create resource creators of an specified type. This function

 * @template ResourceFn  The type of function the resource creator needs to have.
 * @example
 *
 *   type ActionFn = (c: Jimple) => void;
 *   const factory = resourceCreatorFactory<ActionFn>();
 *   const myAction = factory('action', 'fn', (name = 'foo') => (c) => {
